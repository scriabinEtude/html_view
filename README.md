## Features

rendering .html file on Web Platform.


## Reason for creating this package 

To support Web and App within a single flutter project, the dart:html package must be imported. However, when the dart:html package is imported, a Not Found error occurs in the App environment. Since it is essential to display the html file on the screen, we created a package that displays the html file on the screen without generating an error.

## Usage

Please refer to the example.
